* Python (Without the extension pack)

* Rainbow CSV

### LINUX DISTROS

* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS & 24.04 LTS (used up to kernel 6.11)

* Fedora 41 & 42 (used up to kernel 6.16.9 or so)

* Debian 12 (oldstable, 6.1 lts kernel, current distro of choice :) )

### IMPORTANT PACKAGES

* neofetch

* git

* wget & curl

### NOTES

* Make sure package manager repos are configured correctly (and include NordVPN, Chrome repos)

* VMWare Workstation Pro is a .bundle installed from BroadCom -> Auto Updates (idk its just different ig)

* Make sure to keep your distro minimal meaning if we don't need a huge rust toolchain and java environments with jdks and sdks then we don't have them (remove or don't install)

* Use GNOME Terminal - it's just good - like all of the others look and feel good but none are practical enough & work well enough (w/o extreme config - im talking about you kitty)

* JetBrains IDEs are somewhat useful, only if they are needed. VSCode is lighter, faster, and more versatile
 
* Install the Discord .deb **FLATPAKS are not the most useful...umm sorry MESA**

* Install VLC or else

* Gnome-clocks is pretty useful for offline timer ngl

* Have sound recorder and cheese (camera) - theyre useful

* Don't over customize - a distro should be one where we install the files, transfer the files, and don't troubleshoot too much to get everything to work properly

* **ALWAYS USE EITHER APPARMOR OR SELINUX** or install security tools like clamav, rkhunter, etc.
